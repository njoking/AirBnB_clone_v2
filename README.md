| 2. BaseModel | [/models/base_model.py](https://github.com/AllisonOge/AirBnB_clone_v2/blob/master/models/base_model.py) | Defines a parent class to be inherited by all model classes|
| 3. Models (User, State, City, Amenity, Place, and Reviews) | [/models/*.py](https://github.com/AllisonOge/AirBnB_clone_v2/tree/master/models) | Data models for the AirBnB clone project. See [AirBnB_clone#sec.data-model](https://github.com/AllisonOge/AirBnB_clone/tree/main#data-model) for more details |
| 4. FileStorage | [/models/engine/file_storage.py](https://github.com/AllisonOge/AirBnB_clone_v2/blob/master/models/engine/file_storage.py) | Defines a class to manage persistent file storage system. It is instantiated in the `/models/__init__.py` file |
| 5. Console | [console.py](https://github.com/AllisonOge/AirBnB_clone_v2/blob/master/console.py) | Handles console commands for CRUD operations |

## Project design stages

1. The console project (completed - 7 days sprint)
2. Web static project (completed - 2 days sprint)
3. MySQL storage project (active - 6 days sprint)
4. Deploy Web Static (active - 2 days sprint)

## Console CRUD operations

Below, there is a demonstration of some commands possible with the console program. Once the user initiates the command-line interface with the prompt "(hbnb)." They explore available commands using the `help` command, which lists options like `all`, `create`, and `update`. After checking all instances (resulting in an empty list), they create a new User instance with a unique ID using the `create` command. Subsequently, they view all instances, including the newly created User. Using the `update` command, the user modifies the User instance's name attribute. Another `all` command is then used to confirm the update. Finally, the user gracefully exits the command line with the `quit` command.

```bash
(hbnb) help
